<h1>osTicket – Ticket Lifecycle: From Intake to Resolution</h1>

<h2>Communication</h2>

<p>
  <strong> Ben identifies this ticket as a Sev-A (Critical) emergency issue. Since it requires advanced privileges, he reassigns the ticket to the System Administrator department.
Before reassigning, Ben documents a clear internal note and communicates with the end user to acknowledge the issue.
 </strong>
